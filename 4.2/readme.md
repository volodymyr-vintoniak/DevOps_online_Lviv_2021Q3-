This times were developed 3 tasks. In the first was modeled the corporate nnetwork of the  organization, which contains 2
houses of 2 floors in each. Horizontal floor subsystem consists of one working group of 5 computers. Conduct an analysis
network performance and traffic.

from two working groups on 3 and 5 computers accordingly. Draw a logical
structuring the network into 8 subnets (according to the number of working groups).
Analyze the performance of the network and its traffic.
In the task 3 was modeled the local network of the complex of 5 one-storey
buildings. One building - 1 working group of 6 computers. The network is being built
